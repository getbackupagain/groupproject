--the following is the project requirements

/*
Cairn University would like a database to keep track of the careers of alumni,
including who are in a position to provide internships and entry level jobs to current students and recent graduates.  
Use a version control system to share work on the core database structure, 
and each member of the group should also commit, individually, a SQL file containing an INSERT of 5 actual records of alumni.  
Real data may be obtained through online sources such as LinkedIn, personal interviews, or existing university resources.  

Submit the URL to the private repository or the SQL file containing the CREATE statements; in addition to your individual SQL file containing INSERT statements.
