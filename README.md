what it says on the tin. For database design concepts

experience was deemed important to have a second table for because people can have held multiple jobs

-- we used bigint for phoneNumber because phone numbers tend to be bigger than normal int can hold

We probably could have come up with some sort of stored function to make the insertion of rows in the experience table easier
and more intuitive with regards to matching the right alumni id, 
but that was non-essential to the project requirements and we barely got done as it was
